# gorily
GORILY is an old game I developed in 2002-2003. Inspired by the older games I liked.

# Source code
Game was written in Borland Pascal with Objects 7.0. I didn't checked the code if it's complete and can be compiled. However there is running version of the game - thanks to Emscirpten and DOSBox running in browser - https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox.
